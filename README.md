# Color Sensing and Maze Path-Finding Robot

## Overview
This project involves developing an mBot car capable of navigating a maze using color sensing and path-finding algorithms. The robot uses a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm for color recognition and various sensors for navigation and obstacle detection.

## Features
- **Color Recognition**: Utilizes a KNN algorithm to identify different colors.
- **Maze Navigation**: Employs color sensing and path-finding logic to navigate through a maze.
- **Obstacle Detection**: Uses IR-proximity and ultrasonic sensors to detect and avoid obstacles.

## Hardware Components
- **Decoder**: Interprets signals from sensors.
- **Calibrated Light Dependent Resistor (LDR)**: Detects colors by measuring light intensity.
- **IR-Proximity Sensor**: Detects obstacles and walls.
- **Ultrasonic Sensor**: Measures distance to objects.

## Software Components
- **KNN Algorithm**: Implemented for color recognition.
- **Path-Finding Logic**: Developed to navigate the maze based on sensor data.

## Installation
